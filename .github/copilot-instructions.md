# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Knoverafront
The Knovera AI  page is an immersive digital chalkboard that masterfully blends nostalgia with modern technology, utilizing a deep, textured charcoal-black background accented by subtle radial gradients and a realistic "black-chalkboard" pattern to simulate a physical classroom surface. Encased in a thick, mahogany-wood frame with a functional chalk tray at the base, the interface creates a cozy, academic atmosphere that is further enhanced by several floating, hand-drawn "chalk" doodles representing diverse fields of study—including a blue quantum atom, a pink light spectrum prism, green chemical benzene rings, and glowing yellow mathematical formulas like . The typography relies on the "Architects Daughter" font, which mimics authentic handwriting, while a real-time digital clock and date in the top corner provide a functional, lived-in feel. Central to the design is the bold branding "knovera Ai :-" followed by an inspiring Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam quote that grounds the platform's mission in the pursuit of knowledge. The primary call-to-action is a crisp, buttons that pops against the dark background with a slight offset shadow, creating a tactile "pushed" effect that bridges the gap between the vintage chalkboard aesthetic and contemporary web design.
